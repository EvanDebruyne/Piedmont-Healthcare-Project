    <h1>Piedmont Healthcare: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape</h1>
    <p>Understanding threats, threat actors, and defenses in Southeastern U.S. healthcare</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview of Piedmont Healthcare</h2>
    <p>Piedmont Healthcare is a not-for-profit healthcare system serving Georgia with over a dozen hospitals and hundreds of locations. As a major healthcare provider, it's a high-value target for cybercriminals.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Primary Cyber Threats</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ransomware attacks (e.g., Ryuk, Conti, LockBit)</li>
      <li>Phishing campaigns targeting employees</li>
      <li>Data exfiltration of PHI (Protected Health Information)</li>
      <li>Exploitation of outdated medical IoT devices</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Notable Incidents</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>2020 Universal Health Services ransomware attack:</strong> Took down systems across 400+ U.S. facilities, highlighting vulnerabilities in healthcare IT.
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Recent Southeast attacks (2021â€“2023):</strong> Several Georgia hospitals, including Piedmont partners, were hit by phishing and ransomware, forcing patient rerouting.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Threat Actors & Motivations</h2>
    <p>
      Groups like Conti and LockBit are known for targeting healthcare due to its critical nature and likelihood to pay ransom. Many operate from Eastern Europe and are financially motivated. Nation-state actors may also target health orgs for data.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Attack Vectors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Phishing emails (initial access)</li>
      <li>Stolen credentials from prior breaches</li>
      <li>Unpatched vulnerabilities in hospital software</li>
      <li>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Defensive Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Endpoint detection and response (e.g., SentinelOne)</li>
      <li>Email filtering and anti-phishing training</li>
      <li>Network segmentation and firewalls</li>
      <li>Encryption of sensitive data</li>
      <li>Backup and recovery systems (air-gapped backups)</li>
    </ul>
